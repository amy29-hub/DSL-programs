Problem Statement /Definition:-
A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made at either
end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one-dimensional array. Write C++ program to
simulate deque with functions to add and delete elements from either end of the deque.

Objectives:-
1. To understand concept of double ended queue.
2. To study the different ways to implement DQ.
3. To study the applications of DQ.

Outcomes:-
1. To implement primitive operations on DQ.
2. To write functions to use DQ operations in application of Pizza parlour.
