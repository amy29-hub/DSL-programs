Problem Statement /Definition:-
A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically, punctuation,
capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop” is a palindrome, as can
be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina droop” and observing that they are the same
forward and backward. One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and
then compare with them the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program

with functions-
a)To print original string followed by reversed string using stack

b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not.

Objectives:-
1. To understand concept of string.
2. To study the complex operations on string.
3. To understand use of stack

Outcomes:-
1. To implement primitive operations on string and use it for complex solution.
2. To implement stack for string data.
