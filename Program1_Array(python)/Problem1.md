Problem Statement /Definition:-
Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by N
students in the class. Write functions to compute following: 
a) The average score of class 
b)Highest score and lowest score of class 
c) Count of students who were absent for the test 
d) Display mark with highest frequency

Objective:
1. Understand linear storage of data using array data structure.
2. Create these linear structures called Arrays
3. Manipulate the elements in the array using python
4. Understand Creation of class, object and calling of function in python.

Outcome:-
Input:
1. Accept marks scored for first test of subject 'Data Structures and Algorithms' for N students.
2. Store all the values using linear data structure i.e. Array.
3. If student is absent place -1 in array.
Output:
1. Average score of class
2. Highest mark and lowest mark among N students
3. Frequency of Marks
4. Total number of absent students.
