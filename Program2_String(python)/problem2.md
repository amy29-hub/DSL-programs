Problem Statement /Definition:-
Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
a) To display word with the longest length
b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

Objective:-
1. Understand String manipulation operations using array and inbuilt library functions.
2. Create character array and store string in array.
3. String manipulation-using array

Outcome:
Input:
1. Accept String from user
2. Store the string using linear data structure i.e. Array.
Output:
1. Calculate length of longest word from String and display the word.
2. Calculate the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
3. Check whether given string is palindrome or not
4. Display index of first appearance of the substring
5. To count the occurrences of each word in a given string
