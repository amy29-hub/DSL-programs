Problem Statement /Definition:-
Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job
queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are
processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write
functions to add job and delete job from queue.

Objectives:-
1. To understand concept of queue.
2. To study the different types of queues.
3. To study the job scheduling problem as queue application.

Outcomes:-
1. To implement primitive operations on queue.
2. To write functions to use queue for job scheduling and prioritizing jobs.
