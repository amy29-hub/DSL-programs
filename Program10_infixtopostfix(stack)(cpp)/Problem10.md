Problem Statement /Definition:-
Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation-using stack
based on given conditions

a) Operands and operator, both must be single character.
b) Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
c) Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.

Objectives:

1. To understand concept of stack.
2. To study the expression conversion as stack application.

Outcome:-

1. To implement primitive operations on stack.
2. To make use of stack for converting infix expression to postfix.
